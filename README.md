# Trek Community

> Placeholder for the React-based business dashboard for the Trek platform.

This repository was intended to serve as a browser-accessible dashboard for businesses using the Trek service. The goal was to provide business users with access to analytics, account management, and service-specific tools after onboarding.

## Intended Tech Stack

- React with React Router for browser management and Redux for state management
- API integration with Trek services
- Hosted in AWS through EC2

## Status

Created as a placeholder in the Trek suite, this project is no longer maintained. Development was ceased very early in the Trek suite's lifetime when it became clear the original concept too closely mirrored a prior employer's unfinished product. The effort was halted out of an abundance of caution and respect for intellectual boundaries. This particular project never progressed beyond the initial planning phase for Trek.
