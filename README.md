# Trek Community

> Placeholder for the React-based business dashboard for the Trek platform.

This repository was intended to serve as a browser-accessible dashboard for businesses using the Trek service. The application would have provided secure login, real-time analytics, and data management tools to users authenticated via their business credentials.

## Intended Design

- Business account authentication
- Real-time metrics and visualizations
- Access to user and usage data from the associated API
- Tools for managing service tiers, billing, and support tickets

## Status

Created as a placeholder in the Trek suite, this project is no longer maintained. Development was paused very early in the process when it became clear the original concept too closely mirrored a prior employer's unfinished product. The effort was halted out of an abundance of caution and respect for intellectual boundaries.
